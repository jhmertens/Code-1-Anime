<p>
	Japanese animation, commonly known as anime, has a long tradition of cultural significance and global influence. Anime presents one of the few thriving industries for animation outside of the United States and has developed a complex studio system around the medium. Crucially, anime not only constitutes an important cultural artwork that offers a new perspective of Asian cinema to western audiences but also frequently takes advantage of the formal qualities of the medium in ways that denies the conventional wisdom of animation being low art or only for children. In order to fully appreciate the formal experimentation of the genre, one must see it directly. For that, please see the loving fan edit posted below.
